// Topic : - constructors in c++

/*
IMP NOTES:
1 Constructors is basically a special kind of method that is called when an instance of a class is created(ie object is created) , it has no return type it has same name as class name, can have parameters or not, usually used to initialize member variables of class
2 their is a deafault is that is always invoke(in case you havent explicitly defined one ) when an object is created
3 if you define your own constructor then the default constructor is not provided by compiler

using namespace std;
// #define PI 3.14159 //or we can use const double PI {3.14159};
const double PI {3.14159};

        double base_radius{2.4};

    public :
        Cylinder () = default; // this is default constructor we have to explicitly define it if we have defined our own constructor
        Cylinder () {}; // this is also a default constructor
