/*
IMP NOTES:

1 class members can be either raw stack variables or pointers
2 class members cannot be references since references must be initialized when declared but the property of members to be used unintialized is required
3 while private members (variables and functions) cannot be accessed outside of the class but they can be accessed within the class itslef no matter they are private or public or protected
