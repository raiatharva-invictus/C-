// Topic : - arrow notation for obj pointer

/*
1 we can use pointers to manage stack object through pointers(store address), manage eap object through pointers
2 tradtional syntax to dereference is pretty verbose and looks ugly ((*obj).<member>) so better way is using arrow notation (obj-><member>) and is much better and preffered
